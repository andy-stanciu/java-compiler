/**
 * If String compaction is disabled, the bytes in {@code value} are
 * always encoded in UTF16.
 *
 * For methods with several possible implementation paths, when String
 * compaction is disabled, only one code path is taken.
 *
 * The instance field value is generally opaque to optimizing JIT
 * compilers. Therefore, in performance-sensitive place, an explicit
 * check of the static boolean {@code COMPACT_STRINGS} is done first
 * before checking the {@code coder} field since the static boolean
 * {@code COMPACT_STRINGS} would be constant folded away by an
 * optimizing JIT compiler. The idioms for these cases are as follows.
 *
 * For code such as:
 *
 *    if (coder == LATIN1) { ... }
 *
 * can be written more optimally as
 *
 *    if (coder() == LATIN1) { ... }
 *
 * or:
 *
 *    if (COMPACT_STRINGS && coder == LATIN1) { ... }
 *
 * An optimizing JIT compiler can fold the above conditional as:
 *
 *    COMPACT_STRINGS == true  => if (coder == LATIN1) { ... }
 *    COMPACT_STRINGS == false => if (false)           { ... }
 *
 * @implNote
 * The actual value for this field is injected by JVM. The static
 * initialization block is used to set the value here to communicate
 * that this static final field is not statically foldable, and to
 * avoid any possible circular dependency during vm initialization.

// (1)We never cache the "external" cs, the only benefit of creating
// an additional StringDe/Encoder object to wrap it is to share the
// de/encode() method. These SD/E objects are short-lived, the young-gen
// gc should be able to take care of them well. But the best approach
// is still not to generate them if not really necessary.
// (2)The defensive copy of the input byte/char[] has a big performance
// impact, as well as the outgoing result byte/char[]. Need to do the
// optimization check of (sm==null && classLoader0==null) for both.
