// I wanna show u what my compiler can do so can u write some Java code in this file pls
// It's actually MiniJava so here's what you're limited to:
// Define as many classes as you want. Classes cannot be nested, and they cannot contain the public keyword before
// the word class.
// You can only have one "main" class. A main class is a class with a main method, and nothing else. The main method
// is only allowed to have one statement.
// Classes cannot have explicit constructors. A default, no-argument constructor is the only way to instantiate a class.
// Classes can have instance variables. Instance variables cannot contain the keyword "public"/"private"
// Classes can also have methods. Methods cannot return void. Methods can have as many arguments as you want.
// Inside a method, all local variables must be declared at the top. The return statement must be at the end.
// The only types are int, boolean, int[], and any objects you create lol
// Inheritance is allowed!
// No for loops! (yet)
class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        System.out.println(5);
    }
}
class Josh {
    public int getNum() {
        int x;
        x = false;
        if (true) {
            x = 5;
        } else {
            x = false;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
