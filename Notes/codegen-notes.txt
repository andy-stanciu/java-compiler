Extra stuff:
No extensions included in this phase of the project.

Clever code generation strategies:
Nothing too special. Stored the size of arrays in the first 8 bytes and used xor
in a not expression, but I think these are both necessary to do...

Project status:
Everything is working (we hope!). No major surprises, though we decided to include a
semantics check for > 5 parameters for methods since the generated code would
produce undefined behavior otherwise since we don't support pushing overflow arguments
on the stack.

Workload:
The work for this part of the project was once again completed synchronously and in
person. Andy wrote about the first half of the code gen visitor, and I finished up the
rest of it and started writing tests. The work was pretty evenly split, and we spent
a decent amount of time debugging arrays in GDB.
